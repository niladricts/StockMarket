StockTrend Analysis

This is a hands-on assignment from Vincit. Don't dare to touch it. Otherwise, you will be punished by Lord Shiva.

The utility of the code:

1. It tries to do historical stock data analysis and calculates longest upward trend in a given date range.
2. It also tries to get Simple Moving Average for 5 days and compare it with the those trading dates where Opening Price higher than SMA(Simple Moving Average)

Execution Step:

1. Do git clone git@github.com:niladricts/StockMarket.git
2. cd StockMarket
3. python3 main.py

Please note: The utility of getting highest trading volume and most significant stock price cannot be added due to limited knowledge of Stock Market and its
corresponding calculation. The code may not be fully clean but most of the cases adhere to PEP8 standard. I know Vincit recognizes clean coding. But I tried
with my best to have a clean coding standard. Despite of limited knowledge in the domain of Stock Market Analysis, I tried my best. Hope as code geeks, you guys
like this small contribution from my end.
